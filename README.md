# Two Ways of Conceptualizing Employee Attrition
 analyzing hypothetical employee HR data as a classification machine learning and a survival analysis problem

Dataset
- The data for this project comes from The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- This is hypothetical data

Notebooks:
- Employee_Attrition_Classification: includes minimal data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature creation and selection, and finally experimenting with different classification models.
- Employee_Attrition_Survival_Analysis: includes survival analysis walkthrough of the dataset, as well as the building of a rudimentary Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Employee turnover is usually thought of as a classification problem, and various packages and statistical techniques allow for the development of robust models to predict turnover in this way. Survival analysis changes the discussion of employee turnover from which employees will leave to when employees will leave. Both have separate advantages, and being used together may generate the best potential predictive results for organizations.
